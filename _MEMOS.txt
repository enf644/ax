    on start-up alembic checks schema
    alembic changes database with migration scripts


======================================================================================================================================

В пользователях нужно учесть группу - суперпользователи. 
	Они могут создавать и редактировать только свои объекты.
	Таблица с распределением супер-пользователей по объектам
	Какие группы имеют доступ к редактированию объекта
	Как вариант - Админ дает доступ пользователю или группе на Папку в списке объектов.
		Если доступ есть - пользователь может в этой папке создавать объекты и менять уже созданные


Инсталятор - спрашивает БД, схему для данных, схему для хранения пользователей
	Должно быть задисейблено - Auth0, Cognito, Active Directory и т.д.


Что нужно для Рекрера - 
	Единая БД пользователей
	Каждый клуб в отдельной таблице БД, чтобы можно было их разносить по серверам
